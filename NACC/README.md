NACC provides good harmonized multi-modal database to Alzheimer's research community. Work in this repo so far has used the already extracted brain volume related features and perform simple RandomForest based calssification between different groups and also obtain feature importance score for all the features. Results for both full feature set and partial feature set is obtained. Selecting the top feature of interest, we can easliy perform some correlational analysis for a desired target variable.
